### How is it linked to the memebers interests?

![plan](/images/img04.png)

In this challenge, we have teamed up based on directions we both wanted to explore such as gestures, language and non-verbal communication and the graphic representation of these. Nikita focused more on the emotional and descriptive part of the project while Andrea studied the different possibilities that LIDAR offered to represent movements.

### Initial Idea:

We start the week with various ideas;
- Generate a graphic language through symbols and gestures that would work on a graphic level. 
- Representing movements of the human body through the use of kinect and thus generating different images or online body languages and visualize them in VR.

### Planing

### Purpose:

Our purpose during this microchallenge is to generate an immersive installation with which people can see different situations or emotions represented through 3D motion scanning. In this way we give more weight to language and non-verbal communication, often forgotten in online communication and generate a dialogue between the body and virtuality.
